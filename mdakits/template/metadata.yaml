## List(str): a list of commands to use when installing the latest
## release of the code. Note: only one installation method can currently
## be defined. We suggest using mamba where possible (e.g.
##   mamba -c conda-forge install MYPROJECT
## for a conda package installation).
## Here we use a simple PyPi installation:
install:
  - pip install MYPROJECT

## List(str): a list of commands to use when installing the mdakit from its
## source code.
src_install:
  - pip install git+https://github.com/GH_HOST_ACCOUNT/MYPROJECT@main

## str: the package name used to import the mdakit
import_name: MYPACKAGE

## str: a specification for the range of Python versions supported by this MDAKit
python_requires: ">=3.9"

## str: a specification for the range of MDAnalysis versions supported by this MDAKit
mdanalysis_requires: ">=2.0.0"

## List(str): a list of commands to use when attempting to run the MDAKit's tests
## If you package your tests inside your package then you can typically use the 
##     pytest --pyargs MYPACKAGE
## command as shown below. 
## Otherwise you need to include commands to make the tests available. 
## For example, if the tests are in the repository at the top level under `./tests`:
## First use `git clone latest` to either clone the top commit for "development code" checks or check out
## the latest tag for "latest release" checks. Then then run pytest:
##    - git clone latest
##    - pytest -v ./tests
## Feel free to ask for advice on your pull request!
run_tests:
  - pytest --pyargs MYPACKAGE

## List(str): a list of commands to use to install the necessary dependencies required
## to run the MDAKit's tests.
## The default below _might_ be sufficient or you might not even need MDAnalysisTests:
## make sure that it is appropriate for how you run tests.
test_dependencies:
  - mamba install pytest MDAnalysisTests

## str: the organisation name the MDAKit falls under
project_org: GH_HOST_ACCOUNT

## str: the development status of the MDAKit
## See https://pypi.org/classifiers/ for development status classifiers.
development_status: Production/Stable
