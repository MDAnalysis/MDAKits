Improving your MDAKit
#####################

Adding new features
===================
Developing your MDAKit can involve, for example, adding new features, or 
altering existing ones to improve performance or user-friendliness. This may 
come at your own initiative, or the request of a user.

How you develop your kit is up to you! Just remember it's a good idea to  
develop the tests and documentation alongside the new code (and to run the 
existing tests to ensure you aren't causing any unintended changes).


Go beyond the minimal MDAKit Registry requirements
==================================================
The requirements for registering an MDAKit are intentionally minimal to keep 
the entry barrier low. **Going beyond these minimal requirements is highly
recommended**.

This may include (but is not limited to):

- **More tests**: can you get to 100% coverage?!
- **More documentation**: Explain each part of your code. Add examples. Make
  your documentation visually appealing and easy to navigate!
- **Use tooling and workflows**: set up and personalise automatic features to
  check code formatting, run your own automated testing (don't rely solely on 
  the MDAKit Registry's CI!), automatically publish new releases, and more!
- **Community resources**: make it easy for users to report issues, ask 
  questions - or even contribute to your MDAKit themselves!
- **Release on PyPi/conda-forge**: make it easier for users to install your kit! 
- :ref:`Make a journal publication <publishing>`: get recognition for your code!

You could even opt to :ref:`add a logo <logo>` to add unique flair to your MDAKit!


.. note::

    If applicable, remember to :ref:`update your kit's metadata <update-metadata>` 
    so changes and additions are reflected on the Registry.
