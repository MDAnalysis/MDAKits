Publishing your MDAKit!
=======================
Providing a way to easily cite your MDAKit - e.g by having an associated DOI -
can make it easier for users to share your code and for you to get recognition
when someone uses your work.

Ideally, you could publish an article about your kit in a journal such as 
`JOSS <https://joss.readthedocs.io/>`_. JOSS papers are short and
`relatively simple <https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submission-process>`_ -
In meeting the requirements for registering an MDAKit, you will have already
met many of the JOSS submission requirements. Once you've built up your kit's
documentation and testing, consider publication with JOSS or a similar journal!

If you don't have a publication to directly associated with your MDAKit, we 
recommend at least generating a DOI for your code repository, e.g through 
`Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_. If you log in to Zenodo using your GitHub 
account, you can easily do this from the 
`Zenodo GitHub page <https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/>`_.
