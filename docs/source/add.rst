Adding an MDAKit to the Registry
********************************

Do you have an MDAKit? Consider adding it to the Registry!


.. note::
   The MDAKit registry is still in its infancy, we expect that the
   way in which MDAKits are added, and the type of information required,
   may change over time. Please reach out via the `issue tracker`_ if you
   have any questions.


Adding an MDAKit is a simple process, and follows the following steps:
  * Create a fork the MDAKit repository
  * Make a new branch
  * Add a new folder under `mdakits` with the name of your MDAKit
  * Add a metadata YAML file with your MDAKit's details (a template can be found under `mdakits/template`
