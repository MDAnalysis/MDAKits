Licensing
*********

One of the more pressing requirements for kit registration is clearly 
identifying the license that is applied to your code. This is typically included
in a ``LICENSE`` file at the top level of your repository.
`Without a license <https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/>`_, the only 
assumption a user can make about your code is that they are not in a position to
use your code.

Your license needs to be compatible with the GPLv2+ license currently used by 
MDAnalysis, in addition to the licenses of any other packages your MDAKit depends 
on. Take time to consider how you would like to 
`license your project <https://choosealicense.com/>`_.
