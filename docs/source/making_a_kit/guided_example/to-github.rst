*************************
Part 4: Pushing to GitHub
*************************

*See our* `YouTube tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viCPUHkgSxg&t=114s>`_
*for a video demonstration of this section.*

Putting the MDAKit on GitHub will fulfill the requirement that the Kit be hosted
on a version-controlled repository, and finalise the continuous integration set
up in the previous step.

During the cookiecutter generation process, the target GitHub repository 
``<repo_name>`` was identified, and inserted into the workflows configuration as
well as into the ``README.md`` file. 

#. Add this repository as a remote to the local git repository, e.g.:

   .. code-block:: bash

	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/rmsfkit

   (substituting ``myusername`` for your GitHub username). Make sure that this
   repository exists on GitHub and is *empty*.
   
#. Then, push the local code to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: bash

	$ git push origin main

The ``rmsfkit`` repository on GitHub will now be up-to-date the local repository
you have been working on. Navigate to *Actions* on GitHub to see the status of 
the tests. If all was done correctly in the previous sections, these will all 
pass!


Progress: MDAKit requirements
-----------------------------

#. **✓ Uses MDAnalysis**
#. **✓ Open source + OSI license**
#. **✓ Versioned + on a version-controlled repository** -- our code is
   now on GitHub.
#. **✓ Designated authors and maintainers**
#. *(At least) minimal documentation*
#. **✓ (At least) minimal regression tests** -- CI should be up and
   running, and the tests added in the last step all passing.
#. **✓ Installable as a standard package**
#. **✓ (Recommended) community information available**
#. *(Recommended) on a package distribution platform*
