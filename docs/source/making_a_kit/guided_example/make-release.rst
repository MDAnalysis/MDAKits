*********************************
Part 6: Making an initial release
*********************************

*See our* `YouTube tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viCPUHkgSxg&t=247s>`_
*for a video demonstration of this section.*

While using git does satisfy the requirement that our MDAKit code be versioned,
it is a good idea to make numbered releases with (human-understandable) version
numbers to easily track your code as changes and improvements are made.

The MDAKit cookiecutter uses 
`versioningit <https://versioningit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_
for version management. In brief, software versions are set through 
`git tags <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>`_.

#. Since the Kit is initiated without tags, the current version is set to 
   ``0.0.0``. 

   .. code-block:: bash

	>>> import rmsfkit  
	>>> rmsfkit.__version__  
	'0.0.0+3.g0b64a6c'

   *Note: As commits are added, the version is updated with the commit hash. The
   exact output here differs between the YouTube tutorial and video embedded 
   above, and from what you will see.*

   Bump this to a ``0.1.0`` in preparation for an initial release on GitHub 
   using a `git tag`:

   .. code-block:: bash

	$ git tag 0.1.0

   This should now be reflected in the interpreter (though may require a package
   reinstall):

   .. code-block:: bash

	>>> import rmsfkit  
	>>> rmsfkit.__version__  
	'0.1.0'

#. Tags are not pushed to remote repositories by default. To push the ``0.1.0``
   tag, use:

   .. code-block:: bash

	$ git push --tags

#. Viewing the repository tags page on GitHub, you should now see a ``0.1.0`` 
   tag. Expanding its menu gives us the option to create a release based on the 
   tagged code. Enter a release name, such as `v0.1.0` and publish!

Going forward, you could publish this release to a package distribution 
platforms such as PyPi or Conda-Forge, though this is not covered in this 
example.

Having met all the requirements, it's now time to register our MDAKit!
