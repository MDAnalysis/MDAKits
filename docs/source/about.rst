What is an MDAKit?
==================

MDAnalysis Toolkits (MDAKits) are standalone packages containing code using
components from the `MDAnalysis library`_ with the aim of solving specific
scientific problems or in some form enhance the functionality of the MDAnalysis
core library. An MDAKit can be written by anyone and hosted anywhere.

At the discretion of their authors, MDAKits can be **registered** in this
MDAKit registry. To do so, MDAKits have to meet a minimum set of requirements
including; being open-source licensed, hosted in a version control system,
have a clear designation of code authors/maintainers, have some kind of documentation
on their use, and have a minimal set of tests in place.

Registered MDAKits are then `listed here`_ with the intention of providing a centralised
place where the community can find out more about them. Where possible, the MDAKits are
also *continually tested* against the *latest* and *development* versions of MDAnalysis.
This ensures that users and developers have an up-to-date view of the code health of an
MDAKit.

Why?
====

The open sharing of code that abides by the basic principles of `FAIR`_ (findability,
accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) is essential to robust, reproducible,
and transparent science. However, scientists typically are not supported in making the
subtantial effort require to make software FAIR-compliant.

Our goal with MDAKits is to **lower the barrier for researchers to produce FAIR software**.

We wish to support developers in creating new pakages, guiding them through the process
of achieving best practices and FAIR compliance. At the same time, we hope to make MDAnalysis
useful to a broader community.
