Making an MDAKit
****************

The MDAKit registry has a number of :ref:`requirements <requirements>`
to ensure that registered packages are FAIR-compliant and hold up to
an ideal scientific standard.


**Building a Kit from the cookiecutter**

Without prior experience, some of the MDAKit registry requirements
can be daunting. The `MDAKit cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter-mdakit.readthedocs.io/>`_
can be used to aid rapid development of a FAIR-compliant MDAKit
by generating placeholder code for documentation, testing and 
installation. In this section, we provide a walk-through for the
creation of an MDAKit using the cookiecutter.

**Building from an existing project**

If you have an existing package you wish to register as an MDAKit,
(or if you wish to develop one yourself without using the cookiecutter),
chances are very little restructuring is needed for registration.
The primary concern is ensuring that the core MDAKit requirements 
are met - check the links below for things to consider.
