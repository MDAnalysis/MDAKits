*****************************
Part 7: Registering an MDAKit
*****************************

*See our* `YouTube tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viCPUHkgSxg&t=287s>`_
*for a video demonstration of this section.*

The MDAKit registration is the same regardless of how the Kit was created.
When registering your own Kit, be sure to also read the general information in 
the :ref:`add-mdakit` section. 

In order to submit your MDAKit to the registry, you will need to create a pull
request on GitHub against the *MDAnalysis/MDAKits* repository.

#. First, create a fork of the *MDAnalysis/MDAKits* repository on GitHub. 


#. Clone the fork to your local machine, navigate into ``MDAKits/mdakits/``, 
   and make an empty directory with your MDAKit name - this must match the 
   `project_name` you specify below.

   .. code-block:: bash

	git clone git@github.com:yourusername/MDAKits
	cd MDAKits/mdakits
	mkdir rmsfkit/
	cd rmsfkit

#. Add a ``metadata.yaml`` for your MDAKit in this directory. A template can be
   found in ``mdakits/template/metadata.yaml``. See 
   :ref:`the metadata.yaml specifications <specification>` for more details on
   this file and its fields. 

   For our ``rmsfkit``, the contents of ``metadata.yaml`` are:

   .. code-block:: yaml

	project_name: rmsfkit
	authors:
	  - https://github.com/yourusername/rmsfkit/blob/main/AUTHORS.md
	maintainers:
	  - yourusername
	description:
	    An analysis module for calculating the root-mean-square fluctuation of atoms in molecular dynamics simulations.
	keywords:
	  - rms
	  - rmsf
	license: GPL-2.0-or-later
	project_home: https://github.com/yourusername/rmsfkit
	documentation_home: https://rmsfkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        documentation_type: API
        src_install:
          - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rmsfkit.git
          - cd rmsfkit/
          - pip install .

	## Optional entries
	python_requires: ">=3.9"
	mdanalysis_requires: ">=2.0.0"
	run_tests:
	  - pytest --pyargs rmsfkit.tests
	development_status: Beta

#. Commit and push this to your fork, e.g.:

   .. code-block:: bash

        git add metadata.yaml
        git commit -m "Adding rmsfkit"
        git put origin main

#. On the forked repository page in your browser, click *"Contribute"* to make a
   Pull Request (you may need to first refresh for the changes to show up). Add 
   a title with the name of the Kit and add a quick description and click 
   *"Create pull request"*.

   Once the tests have passed, you can add a comment along the lines of 
   *"@MDAnalysis/mdakits-reviewers, ready for review"*. The reviewers will get 
   back to you with any change requests before merging it in as a Kit.

At this point there are no additional steps for registering your kit! However,
your responsibility for your new MDAKit does not end here. Once on the Registry,
the weekly CI runs will notify you if anything starts failing; and you can 
continue to expand and improve your code, it's documentation/tests, make 
releases, and so on. Read the information on the :ref:`maintaining` page for 
more.
