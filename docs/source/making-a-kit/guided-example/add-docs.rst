Part 5: Providing documentation
*******************************

*See our* `YouTube tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viCPUHkgSxg&t=153s>`_
*for a video demonstration of this section.*

When registering an MDAKit, you'll be asked to identify which of the following
(or combination thereof) best describes your documentation (*note that these are
very flexible descriptions, and may cover a range of documentation styles and 
levels of detail*):

- **README**: a ``README.md``-type file containing basic information 
  (description, installation, usage).
- **API**: 'technical' documentation, describing the functions/methods/etc and
  their input/outputs.
- **User Guide**: more 'user friendly' documentation, similar to but likely 
  expanding on README-style documentation; may include more detailed usage, 
  descriptions, examples, etc.

To keep registration easily attainable, MDAKits require only **minimal 
documentation** - e.g. only a ``README.md``. However, more extensive 
documentation is a good idea. We demonstrate here the process for adding further
documentation for ``rmsfkit``.

`Read the Docs <read the docs_>`_ can be used to build and host documentation 
online. The cookiecutter includes a *Read the Docs* configuration as well a 
pre-made documentation environment file that is used by *Read the Docs* and for 
building locally. Frameworks for autogenerated API and basic User Guide 
documentation are also provided.


Building documentation locally
------------------------------

You can build documentation locally to check on the appearance as you work on
it.

#. First, add the required packages (listed in the autogenerated 
   ``requiremenets.yaml`` file) to the environment: 

   .. code-block:: bash

	mamba env update --name rmsfkit -f requirements.yaml

#. Then the documentation HTML files can be built by running:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

	make html

   This uses instructions in the included ``Makefile`` to convert 
   reStructuredText files in the ``source/`` directory into HTML files in 
   ``_build``. These files can now be opened and viewed. 
  
To view changes to the documentation after changing any of the source files, 
rerun ``make html`` and refresh the browser.


Adding to the documentation
---------------------------

**The cookiecutter-generated template**

The cookiecutter starts our documentation with three pages:

- ``index``: a "home" page with a table of contents, but otherwise blank.
- ``getting_started``: a blank page intended to contain information for
  potential users.
- ``API``, containing API documentation autogenerated from the docstrings.

These files are written in 
`reStructuredText syntax <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_, and can 
now be added to expand the documentation.

#. **Expanding the API documentation**: for our ``rmsfkit`` example, the 
   autogenerated API documentation does not currently contain all of the 
   information found in the code docstrings. This is because the 'autosummary' 
   in ``source/api.rst`` by default specifies ``rmsfkit``, rather than 
   specifically the analysis class, ``rmsfkit.RMSF``. We update it, so 
   ``api.rst`` now reads:

   .. code-block:: rst

	API Documentation
	=================
	
	.. autosummary::
	   :toctree: autosummary
	
	   rmsfkit.RMSF

   After rerunning ``make html`` and refreshing, there will be a table entry
   for the RMSF class. Clicking this will open the documentation that was 
   present in the docstrings.


#. **Updating the home page**: ``index.rst`` will be the landing page for our 
   User Guide. To make it more welcoming, let's add a short desciption of our 
   code:

   .. code-block:: rst

	Welcome to rmsfkit's documentation!
	=========================================================
	
	``rmsfkit`` is an example MDAKit that implements the functionality of the `analysis.rms.RMSF` class within the MDAnalysis package.
	This MDAKit does not serve as a replacement for this functionality and using this MDAKit for real work is discouraged.
	
	.. toctree::
	   :maxdepth: 2
	   :caption: Contents:
	
	   getting_started
	   api
	
	
	Indices and tables
	==================
	
	* :ref:`genindex`
	* :ref:`modindex`
	* :ref:`search`


#. **Adding installation information**: The ``getting_started`` page is intended
   to provide information for users to get started with our code. Let's add some
   installation instructions for ``rmsfkit``:

   .. code-block:: rst

	Getting Started
	===============
	
	The ``rmsfkit`` package is installable from source.
	
	.. code-block:: bash
	
	    git clone git@github.com:ianmkenney/rmsfkit.git
	    cd rmsfkit/
	    pip install .


   We could add more information here (or in additional pages) demonstrating  
   usage; but as this is covered by the API documentation, we will stop here 
   for now.
   

**Citations in documentation**

You can include citations in your docs using the bibtex format. We demonstrate
this below to fix an unformatted citation (``:cite:p:`Welford1962```) in the 
``rmsfkit.RMSF`` class documentation. 


#. We first create a bibtex file, ``references.bib`` in the ``doc/source/`` 
   directory:

   .. code-block::

	@article{Welford1962,
	    author = { B. P.   Welford},
	    title = {Note on a Method for Calculating Corrected Sums of Squares and Products},
	    journal = {Technometrics},
	    volume = {4},
	    number = {3},
	    pages = {419-420},
	    year  = {1962},
	    publisher = {Taylor & Francis},
	    doi = {10.1080/00401706.1962.10490022}
	}

#. In the confirguration file ``conf.py``, we need to add a new extension 
   (``sphinxcontrib.bibtex``) as well as the name of the bibtex file:

   .. code-block:: Python

	extensions = [
	    'sphinx.ext.autosummary',
	    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
	    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',
	    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
	    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
	    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
	    'sphinx.ext.extlinks',
	    'sphinxcontrib.bibtex',  # add this line
	]
	
	bibtex_bibfiles = ['references.bib'] # and this one!

#. We also have to add this extension the install requirements in 
   ``docs/requirements.yaml`` - add ``- sphinxcontrib-bibtex`` as an additional
   dependency here.

#. Finally, update the environment with

   .. code-block:: bash

	mamba env update --name rmsfkit -f requirements.yaml

   before once again running ``make html``.

Refreshing the documentation will now show a properly formatted citation using 
the information in the bibtex file.


Deploying the documentation
---------------------------

After pushing documentation changes to GitHub, you can then display them on 
their own shiny new website!

#. Make sure all changes are pushed to GitHub. Log into 
   `Read the Docs <read the docs_>`_ (using your GitHub account) and navigate to
   the dashboard -  click the "Import a Project" button.

   .. image:: ../../img/rmsftutorial/import.png
	:alt: Import a project into RTD

#. Find the Kit repository and click "+". Confirm that the name, URL, and 
   default branch (likely be `main`) are correct.

   .. image:: ../../img/rmsftutorial/adding.png
	:alt: Adding your repository to RTD

#. Clicking next will begin the deployment. This immediately starts the build
   process, which can be confirmed by clicking the "Builds" tab. Once the build 
   is completed, you can view the deployed documentation (which is now public!). 
   
This completes the documentation requirement for an MDAKit! Notice that the "docs"
badge in the GitHub rendered ``README.md`` is now green.


Progress: MDAKit requirements
-----------------------------

#. **✓ Uses MDAnalysis**
#. **✓ Open source + OSI license**
#. **✓ Versioned + on a version-controlled repository**
#. **✓ Designated authors and maintainers**
#. **✓ (At least) minimal documentation** - documentation is now included
   with the code and hosted online.
#. **✓ (At least) minimal regression tests**
#. **✓ Installable as a standard package**
#. **✓ (Recommended) community information available**
#. *(Recommended) on a package distribution platform*
