*******************
Part 2: Adding code
*******************

*See our* `YouTube tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viCPUHkgSxg&t=48s>`_
*for a video demonstration of this section.*

The cookiecutter created a ``<package_name>/`` directory where the MDAKit's 
code can live - now it's time to start adding that code!

#. In this example, we are recreating the existing MDAnalysis RMSF analysis, so
   we will simply copy and paste this analysis class into a new file,
   ``rmsfkit/rmsfkit.py``. The in-code documentation (which has been trimmed 
   here for brevity) is written in 
   `reStructuredText syntax <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ for 
   building with Sphinx later. 

   The contents of the file now resemble the following code block:

   .. code-block:: python

	"""
	rmsfkit.py
	A package to perform RMSF analysis on molecular dynamics data.
	
	All code and documentation, both of which are trimmed for the sake of brevity,
	are taken from the MDAnalysis Python package. Used under GPLv2+.
	"""
	
	from MDAnalysis.analysis.base import AnalysisBase
	import numpy as np
	
	class RMSF(AnalysisBase):
	    r"""Calculate RMSF of given atoms across a trajectory.
	
	    Note
	    ----
	    No RMSD-superposition is performed; it is assumed that the user is
	    providing a trajectory where the protein of interest has been structurally
	    aligned to a reference structure. The protein also has to be whole because
	    periodic boundaries are not taken into account.
	
	    Run the analysis with :meth:`RMSF.run`, which stores the results in the
	    array :attr:`RMSF.results.rmsf`.
	
	    """
	    def __init__(self, atomgroup, **kwargs):
	        r"""Parameters
	        ----------
	        atomgroup : AtomGroup
	            Atoms for which RMSF is calculated
	        verbose : bool (optional)
	             Show detailed progress of the calculation if set to ``True``; the
	             default is ``False``.
	
	        Raises
	        ------
	        ValueError
	             raised if negative values are calculated, which indicates that a
	             numerical overflow or underflow occurred
	
	        Notes
	        -----
	        The root mean square fluctuation of an atom :math:`i` is computed as the
	        time average
	
	        .. math::
	
	          \rho_i = \sqrt{\left\langle (\mathbf{x}_i - \langle\mathbf{x}_i\rangle)^2 \right\rangle}
	
	        No mass weighting is performed. 
	        
	        This method implements an algorithm for computing sums of squares while
	        avoiding overflows and underflows :cite:p:`Welford1962`.

	            raise ValueError("Some RMSF values negative; overflow " +
	                             "or underflow occurred")

#. We have now added the ``RMSF`` analysis class to our package. Finally, to 
   make this class easier to access, we import it in ``__init__.py`` by adding:

   .. code-block:: python

	from .rmsfkit import RMSF


Progress: MDAKit requirements
-----------------------------

#. **✓ Uses MDAnalysis** - the added code uses the MDAnalysis ``AnalysisBase``
   class, and takes MDAnalysis ``AtomGroup`` objects as inputs.
#. **✓ Open source + OSI license**
#. *Versioned + on a version-controlled repository*
#. **✓ Designated authors and maintainers**
#. *(At least) minimal documentation*
#. *(At least) minimal regression tests*
#. **✓ Installable as a standard package**
#. **✓ (Recommended) community information available**
#. *(Recommended) on a package distribution platform*
