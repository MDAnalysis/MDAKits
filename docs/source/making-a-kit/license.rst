Licensing
*********

One of the more pressing requirements for kit registration is clearly 
identifying the license that is applied to your code. This is typically 
included in a ``LICENSE`` file at the top level of your repository.
`Without a license <https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/>`_, the 
only assumption a user can make about your code is that they are not in 
a position to use your code.

Your license needs to be compatible with the GPLv2+ license currently 
used by MDAnalysis, in addition to the licenses of any other packages 
your MDAKit depends on. Take time to consider how you would like to 
`license your project <https://choosealicense.com/>`_.

Further information on open source licensing can be found from sources 
such as: `choose a license <https://choosealicense.com/>`_, 
`tl;dr Legal <https://tldrlegal.com/>`_, the 
`Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org/osd>`_, and the 
`Software Sustainability Insitute <https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/choosing-open-source-licence>`_.
