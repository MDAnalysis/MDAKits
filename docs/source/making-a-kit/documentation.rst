Documentation
*************

Basic documentation is **required** for MDAKit registration. The detail 
and depth of the documentation is ultimately up to you, but we require
**at a minimum** that you provide README-style documentation explaining 
what the code is supposed to do, how to install it, and the basics of 
its use.

Although this is the minimum, we highly recommend that you consider 
generating your documentation with dedicated tools such as 
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, which allows you to 
generate static documentation using 
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
-formatted plain text directly from your code. This makes it easier for 
your documentation to change alongside code changes.

Using a **documentation hosting service** such as 
`Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ or 
`GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ allows easy public access 
to your automatically generated documentation.
