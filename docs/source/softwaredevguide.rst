A (brief) overview on software development
##########################################

This guide is intended to provide an introduction for scientists interested in 
creating an MDAKit, who may not be familiar with software development terms and 
best practices.
As such, it has an **MDAnalysis-centric perspective**, and will often list tools
and methods that are specific to Python packages. These do not represent the 
the only way of doing things, nor are all MDAKits required to by pure Python 
packages.
However, it is hoped this guide will still serve broadly as a general introduction 
to soem basic concepts in software development.
