********************************
Adding an MDAKit to the Registry
********************************

Do you have an MDAKit? Consider adding it to the 
:ref:`MDAKits Registry! <mdakits>`.

.. note::   
   The `MDAKit registry`_ is still in its initial stages. We expect that the way 
   in which MDAKits are added, and the type of information required, may change
   over time. Please reach out via the `issue tracker`_ if you have any
   questions.

Registering an MDAKit requires you to create a single file with meta information
(called ``metadata.yaml``) describing the Kit, and add this to the 
`MDAnalysis/mdakits repository`_ on GitHub. The links below provide information
about this process and more detail about the ``metadata.yaml`` file.
