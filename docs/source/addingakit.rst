Adding an MDAKit to the Registry
********************************

Do you have an MDAKit? Consider adding it to the `MDAKit registry`_!


.. note::   
   The `MDAKit registry`_ is still in its initial stages. We expect that the way in
   which MDAKits are added, and the type of information required, may change
   over time. Please reach out via the `issue tracker`_ if you have any
   questions.

**The registration process**

Registering an MDAKit requires you to create a single file with metadata
(called ``metadata.yaml``) describing the kit, and . You add this file to the `MDAnalysis/mdakits
repository`_ on GitHub. Links below.
