Documentation

**could split this up**

What is it?
-----------
- Information about your code + how to use it
- Important terms - types of documentation: README, docstrings, API, userguide
- Closely related: CHANGELOG, badges (e.g. code coverage, status), contribution instructions

More detail:
- Things to cover
     Installation instructions, description, example usage, tutorials/notebooks,
     trouble shooting, function input/output 

Why is it important?
--------------------
- README to provide a quick overview
- docstrings/API help you remember what your own code does, 'more advanced' users/contributors
  know what they can do, easier to troubleshoot
- User Guides: more friendly to newcomers, explain *how* code works


How is it done?
---------------
- Local docs vs. hosting online
  Hosting directly from code vs. separate (e.g. mda docs vs. User Guide)
- README + markdown (+ display on GitHub)
- docstring conventions - what to cover + format (link)
- Sphinx/ReadTheDocs/rst (+ from GitHub)

    Quick summary of some particularly useful Sphinx things (toctree, autosummary, ...)
