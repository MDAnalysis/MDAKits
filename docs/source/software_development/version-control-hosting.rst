Version control and distributed software development
####################################################

Version control
===============
What is it?
-----------
- Keeping track of changes in files, manage how changes are combined
- Important terms: repository, branches, commit, merge

More detail:
- branch naming 'conventions': main, develop, ...

Why is it important?
---------------------
- Work on multiple things/with multiple people
- Track who did what, when did things break, undo things


How is it done?
---------------
git - but also mercurial
  Quick summary cheatsheet: init, branch, checkout
                            add, commit, reset


Hosting a repository
====================
*GitHub is suggested for MDAKits, since you'll need a GitHub account 
to register a Kit, but not required.*

What is it?
-----------
- Putting repositories where they can be accessed online
- Important terms: local vs remote, origin/upstream/fork/clone; pull requests+review
- Highlight: Git vs. GitHub


Why is it important?
--------------------
- better sharability/accessibiltiy of the above
- can provide lots of ways to add/automate lots of things! e.g. see GitHub below


How is it done?
---------------
GitHub - but also GitLab, BitBucket
   Quick summary cheatsheet: clone, push, pull
   Link to where we describe fork+clone+push+PR in examples?



Overview of things you can do with GitHub
=========================================
(gather links to relevant sections)

- Issues + Pull Requests (and can have templates for these)
- GitHub discussion
- git tags + releases
- GitHub actions: codecov, tests/CI, linters, ...
- documentation: readmes, tie into readthedocs, githubpages
