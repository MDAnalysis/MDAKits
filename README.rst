Contents
========

This repository contains the source code for the MDAKits registry.
The registry hosts a list of MDAKits which it then both documents
and continually validate.

For more details about the MDAKit registry, see Section 4 of the
`MDAKit Whitepaper`_.


Creating a new MDAKit
=====================

The minimum specification for an MDAKit is defined under Section 3 of the
`MDAKit Whitepaper`_. To developers in creating best practices adhering
projects, a `cookiecutter`_ has been made available.


Adding a new MDAKit
===================

The registry is currently in development, the way by which new MDAKits
are added is likely to change significantly over time. If you have any
concerns or questions about the process, please reach out by raising an
issue!

Adding a new MDAKit involves making a PR against
this repository and adding a new `metadata`_ file within it's own
respective directory under `mdakits`.


Workflow
========

Shown below is the MDAKit framework workflow.
