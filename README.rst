=====================================

Contents
========

This repository contains the source code for the MDAKits registry.
The registry hosts a list of MDAKits which it then both documents
and continually validate.

For more details about the MDAKit registry, see Section 4 of the
`MDAKit Whitepaper`_.


Creating a new MDAKit
=====================

The minimum specification for an MDAKit is defined under Section 3 of the
`MDAKit Whitepaper`_. To developers in creating best practices adhering
projects, a `cookiecutter`_ has been made available.


Adding a new MDAKit
===================

The registry is currently in development, we do not currently accept
external MDAKits at the moment. Once the registry becomes publicly
available, adding a new MDAKit will solely involve making a PR against
this repository and adding a new `metadata`_ file within it's own
respective directory under `mdakits`. Please see Section 4 of the
`MDAKit Whitepaper`_ for more details.


Workflow
========

Shown below is the MDAKit framework workflow.
