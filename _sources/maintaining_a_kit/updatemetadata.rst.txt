Updating the MDAKit's metadata
==============================
As your kit evolves, you may find the information you supplied in the 
:ref:`metadata <specification>` file at registration is no longer valid (e.g.
the installation instructions mught require updating), or wish to otherwise
alter or add new details (e.g. adding a publication, or expanding the 
description).

**If you don't update your metadata, potential users could be getting the wrong
information, and/or the automated tests run by the MDAKit Registry could fail.**

To update your kit's metadata, simply edit the kit's ``metadata.yaml`` (in your
fork of the ``MDAKits`` repository), then make a new Pull Request (PR). The 
MDAKits team will then review and merge your PR to apply the changes.
