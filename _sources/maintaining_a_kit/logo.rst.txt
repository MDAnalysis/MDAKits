Adding a logo for your MDAKit
=============================
A custom logo can add some pizazz to your MDAKit. You are welcome to create an
entirely custom logo, use the default `'empty gear' template`_, 
or modify the template - feel free to place your logo within the gears!

If you used the MDAKits cookiecutter, there is already a placeholder logo in 
your documentation. The `MDAKits cookiecutter documentation`_ has information 
on updating this.

.. note::
   MDAnalysis recommends that kit authors carefully check that any material used 
   in their kit - including logos - is used under appropriate licenses, and do
   not infringe on any copyrights. 
   
   MDAnalysis cannot give any legal advice on these matters; if you are unsure 
   about any legal matters, please consult a lawyer.
