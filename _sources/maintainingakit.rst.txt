Maintaining an MDAKit

   This section is still under construction. If you have topics you would
   like to see covered here, please get in touch via 
   `MDAnalysis Github Discussions`_.

Successfully registering an MDAKit is not the end of the journey! A
software package still requires input to keep it healthy and thriving. 
This includes both expanding and adding new features and ensuring the MDAKit 
continues to run as intended. **While not required for an MDAKit to remain in
the registry, such activities are highly encouraged**. 


Now that it is registered, your kit will be part of the :ref:`MDAKits Registry CI <mdakitsci>`:
your kits' tests (as specified in ``metadata.yaml``) are automatically rerun 
twice each week, so that you (and potential users) have assurance that your 
code still works as intended, or are notified when it does not. 

**However, the ultimate responsibility for maintaining your MDAKit remains with
you.**


The sections below provide some information to keep in mind for maintaining your
MDAKit after registration.
