Guided Example: Building an RMSF analysis Kit
*********************************************

In this section, we provide a guided example for creating an MDAKit
using the `MDAKit cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter-mdakit.readthedocs.io>`_.
A `video walk-through <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viCPUHkgSxg>`_ 
of this tutorial is available on YouTube:

We will create a kit for RMSF analysis, replicating the functionality 
of the `RMSF analysis class <https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/analysis/rms.html#MDAnalysis.analysis.rms.RMSF>`_ 
in the core library.

First, let's refresh ourselves on the :ref:`requirements <requirements>` 
for a 'registerable' kit. In brief:

**MDAKit requirements**

#. Uses MDAnalysis
#. Open source + OSI license
#. Versioned + on a version-controlled repository
#. Designated authors and maintainers
#. (At least) minimal documentation
#. (At least) minimal regression tests
#. Installable as a standard package
#. (Recommended) community information available
#. (Recommended) available on a package distribution platform


Below are the steps we'll go through to create our MDAKit. We'll check
back in after each part to see how we're progressing through these
requirements!
