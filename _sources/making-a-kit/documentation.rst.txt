Documentation
*************

Basic documentation is **required** for MDAKit registration. The detail and 
depth of the documentation is ultimately up to you, but we require **at a 
minimum** that you provide README-style documentation explaining what the code
is supposed to do, how to install it, and the basics of its use.

Although this is the minimum, we highly recommend that you consider generating
your documentation with dedicated tools such as 
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, which allows you to generate
static documentation using 
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
-formatted plain text directly from your code. This makes it easier for your
documentation to change alongside code changes.

Using a **documentation hosting service** such as 
`Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ or 
`GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ allows easy public access to your
automatically generated documentation.
